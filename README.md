# BadCat
Project to keep my cat off the counter top

Placeholder until I get this proper.

This project is a culmianation of things I know I can do, and things I want to learn to do.

The point of this project is to keep my cat of the counter tops, knocking brakeble things off, and repeating.  This will consist of:

1) Video image recognition using RPi TensorFlow (and possibly a Coral TPU)
2) Pan/ Tilt tracking of the camera to scan and find the cat
3) Pan / Tilt / Load / Fire of a 3d Printed nerf compatable blaster
4) All the fiddly bits needed to tie it together.
